Dependable
==========

Downloads an application's dependencies and does things with them.

Note that Dependable is a work in progress (if that wasn't obvious from the questionable code and empty Doxygen headers).
Currently bad input files or unavailable dependencies will cause the program to exit in a less-than-graceful manner.
